# Packaging and releases

The primary distribution is a Debian package for Ubuntu and Debian-derived Linux hosts
(including supported Jetson and Raspberry Pi systems). It uses the host's Python 3.9+
and systemd; it bundles neither Python nor OS/NVIDIA binaries. Runtime Python remains
standard-library only. `Architecture: all` means the files are architecture-independent,
not that every OS/kernel has been validated. A device whose Python is older than 3.9
needs a supported OS/interpreter before installation.

## Versioning

`VERSION` in `frontends/cli.py` is the single source of the application version. The
server imports it; the builder reads that assignment without importing the collector.
The copied CLI stays one independent file. Check versions with:

```sh
platmon --version
python3 /usr/share/platmon/platmon.py --version
dpkg-query -W platmon
```

Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH: patch for compatible fixes, minor for compatible features,
major for breaking changes. During 0.x development, document any breaking change in
the changelog before release. API `schema_version` remains a separate contract; a
release bump does not change it. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change as `VERSION`.

The first application version is `0.1.0`, initially unreleased. Debian package versions
append a packaging revision: `0.1.0-1`. A packaging-only rebuild can use `-2` without
changing the application version. Never replace an already released version's files.

## Build

Build on Linux with Python 3.9+ and the installed `dpkg-deb` tool (dpkg 1.19+).
No Python build dependency or root access is needed:

```sh
python3 scripts/package.py --output dist/0.1.0-1
python3 scripts/check_package.py dist/0.1.0-1/platmon_0.1.0-1_all.deb
(cd dist/0.1.0-1 && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)
```

The fresh output directory contains `.deb`, `platmon-0.1.0.tar.gz`, `BUILD.json`
(input content hashes and versions) and `SHA256SUMS`. The source archive includes
runtime, tests, installation/build scripts and documentation, excluding caches and
private validation artifacts. It can rebuild the package without `.git`.
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` controls timestamps; the default is zero. With identical inputs,
epoch and build tools, repeated builds produce identical artifacts. The builder
refuses existing output filenames. Packaging revision: `--revision 2`.

## Install and update

Download a fixed release, verify its checksums and keep its files for rollback.
Install the local package using APT, which checks the declared host dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install ./platmon_0.1.0-1_all.deb
systemctl status platmon --no-pager
platmon --version
platmon --once
```

Code goes to `/usr/share/platmon/`, the client to `/usr/bin/platmon`, the vendor unit
to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/platmon.service`, and config to `/etc/platmon/platmon.ini`.
The code keeps its existing directory structure and relative web paths. The service
retains DynamicUser, ProtectSystem, ProtectHome and NoNewPrivileges. Logs:
`journalctl -u platmon`. Configure the listener and restart with
`sudo systemctl restart platmon`; `platmon --once host:port` follows a custom port.

The INI is a dpkg conffile. Locally edited settings are preserved unless you explicitly
choose the maintainer's replacement at a dpkg prompt. For unattended updates, choose
your conffile policy explicitly; do not assume a prompt is answered automatically.
Existing explicit `enabled = no` values remain effective. Omitted options follow the
new version's defaults, so read its changelog before updating.

Upgrades validate the preserved INI before restarting the service. They preserve an
administrator's disabled/masked service state and respect Debian's service-start policy.
A config or restart failure leaves dpkg reporting the failure; it is not an automatic
rollback. Check `/api/status` ready and `/api/stats` 200 after starting, and check the
expected readings on the actual device. The health check is not evidence that every
sensor or filesystem is exposed. The unauthenticated API belongs on a trusted network.

```sh
sudo apt remove platmon    # removes code and stops service; preserves config
sudo apt purge platmon     # also removes the packaged conffile
```

The package does not remove unrelated files in `/etc/platmon`. Use APT for packaged
installations; source install/uninstall scripts refuse an installed dpkg package.

## Migrate a source or Docker installation

Do this during a maintenance window. First preserve the old checkout/version, INI,
unit, CLI and the previous image (for Docker); record whether the service was running
and enabled. Keep the files outside paths removed by the old uninstaller.

For the source installation, run `scripts/systemd/uninstall.sh` from the old checkout,
without `--purge`, after the backup. This stops/disables the service, removes its local
unit and command, and preserves `/etc/platmon/platmon.ini`. Then install the package.
The first package install refuses an existing `/etc/systemd/system/platmon.service`
(including a mask) rather than deleting it. Package upgrades/reinstalls preserve
administrator units and masks. An administrator's custom source unit needs explicit review
and migration to a drop-in. `/etc` units otherwise override the packaged vendor unit.

For Docker, stop/remove the old container with `scripts/docker/stop.sh`, keep its image
and compose/config files, and copy the desired INI to `/etc/platmon/platmon.ini` before
installing. Do not run both services on the same listener. The container's mount-specific
environment does not carry into the native service; compare device readings after migration.

Check `command -v platmon` and `type -a platmon`. An old `~/.local/bin/platmon` or
`/usr/local/bin/platmon` can shadow `/usr/bin/platmon`. Remove it with its original
`scripts/install-cli.sh --uninstall` (add `--user` for the user install), after verifying
it belongs to platmon, or explicitly use `/usr/bin/platmon`. The package never deletes
administrator-owned local commands.

## Rollback

Before an update, retain the previous `.deb` and back up the operational INI. To roll
back during a maintenance window, stop platmon, restore the compatible backed-up INI,
and install the retained package with `sudo apt install --allow-downgrades ./OLD.deb`.
Check the dpkg conffile prompt, the application/package versions, readiness and expected
readings. Restore the previous enabled/running state explicitly. In-memory history is
lost on restart. Keep both packages and configurations until acceptance completes.

To reverse a source-to-package migration, remove the package without purging config,
restore the old INI, and reinstall the retained old checkout with its source installer.
To reverse a Docker-to-package migration, remove the package, restore the retained
Docker config/CLI and start the retained image using the old deployment procedure.

The source installer now stages files before stopping, restores previous code/unit on
failed replacement/readiness, and keeps successful update backups in the printed
`/opt/.platmon-install.XXXXXX` directory. Retain the matching checkout, CLI and INI too;
the directory is not a complete deployment backup. On failure, inspect the printed
recovery directory and service state, especially if restoring/restarting also failed.
For a later manual rollback, prefer reinstalling the retained old checkout. Backup
directories are never automatically deleted by subsequent updates or uninstall.

## Release procedure

1. Update the single VERSION and changelog. Review the scoped change and run
   `git diff --check`, `pytest -v`, the build and package checker.
2. Test fresh install, upgrade with an edited INI, downgrade, remove/purge and existing
   installation migration. CI uses an isolated container for dpkg lifecycle checks;
   actual systemd sandbox/startup and ARM device readings require real-device acceptance.
3. Merge the reviewed change into `main` using the repository's signing/hooks policy.
   Tag the verified commit included in `main` as `v0.1.0`; use `v0.1.0-2` for packaging
   revision 2. Confirm the intended commit and required checks before pushing the tag.
   Creating a local tag alone does not start the workflow. This document does not create a tag.
4. The release workflow fetches `main` and rejects tags whose commit is not an ancestor
   of its current tip, before building. It verifies tag/version/changelog, runs tests and package checks,
   then creates a **draft** GitHub Release with the four artifacts. Review the attached
   bytes, acceptance evidence and notes before publishing the draft. Do not distribute
   a container image; the repository's existing image licensing policy still applies.

The repository's active `release-tags` tag ruleset targets `refs/tags/v*`: new tags
are allowed, but existing tags cannot be updated or deleted, with no bypass actors.
Use a new application version or packaging revision instead of moving a release tag.
The desired configuration is tracked in `.github/rulesets/release-tags.json`;
changing that file alone does not change GitHub settings. Apply it through the repository
ruleset API and confirm the live settings. The workflow's `main` check runs after a tag
push; it prevents release creation rather than rejecting the original tag push.

APT hosting is a later operational choice; no APT repository or signing key is created
by these scripts. Releases currently use stable MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versions only.

To run the dpkg lifecycle check locally, use Docker and a disposable Ubuntu container:

```sh
python3 scripts/package.py --revision 2 --output dist/0.1.0-2
python3 scripts/check_package_install.py dist/0.1.0-1/*.deb dist/0.1.0-2/*.deb
```

This installs test OS tools inside the container, mounts only the artifact directories
read-only and removes the container afterward. It checks config preservation,
disabled/masked state, downgrade, remove/purge, source-unit refusal and invalid-config
recovery. It does not boot systemd or change host services. CI runs the same check.
